# Using Artificial Intelligence for Estimating People's Perception of the World

### Setup to run code
To run detected targets the model weights needs to be added.
These are not added in the git because they are too large to commit.
The only model weights used for this project is *demo.pt*, which can be found at their git repository: https://github.com/ejcgt/attention-target-detection
The file is to be placed in the following folder *Estimating_individuals_perspectives/detecting_attended_targets/model_weights/*.

### Test Data and Results
The raw videos and test data can be found in *Test_Data_Result*
All raw videos are compressed into zip files.
